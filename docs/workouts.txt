Casual Plans
Instructions
• The CASUAL templates are for people who plan to train 2-3 days per week.
The objective is to train your full body every time you show up to the gym.
Therefore, there is only ONE full-body training split that you should repeat
every time you show up to the gym.
• You may switch between 60- and 90-minute training day plans depending on
time constraints.
• You may also switch between strength and hypertrophy-focused plans. But I
recommend that you stick to either a strength or hypertrophy plan for at least
a few months before switching.
• You should repeat these 1-day splits for a long period of time and strive
to progressively overload each time you follow each training day plan. But
you should start out by going EASY and then PROGRESSIVELY INCREASE THE
WEIGHT AND INTENSITY (or any other form of progressive overload per the
progressive overload section of this book)!
• Do not train with weights two days in a row. Make sure you have at least one
non-lifting day in between weight training days!
• Don’t forget to warm-up with 10 minutes of moderate intensity cardio.
• Make sure you READ the notes for each exercise where they are indicated.
THEY ARE IMPORTANT!!!! DON’T BE A MORON WHO DOESN’T READ!!!
• Make sure you go in the order of the plans from top to bottom of the page.
All plans begin with a compound movement of choice because those are the
hardest. Don’t bullshit me and do your curls before your bench!
• Weights are just a suggestion of how to progress in weight. Always choose
weights that allow you to achieve the desired intensity in the target rep range.
• Do not go “all out” at first! I do not want you to overtrain. You have to “do
more than last time,” but you also have to crawl before you walk and walk
before you run.69

PART 1: SQUATS & LATS/BICEPS ALTERNATING SETS
Notes & Instructions
• For Squat of Choice/Leg Press: Control the weight the entire time and focus on a SLOW eccentric/TUT. Each set should take approximately
30-40 seconds.
• For Pull-Up/Lat Pull-Down/Chin-Up/Supinated Grip Lat Pull-Down: focus on controlling the weight/a slow eccentric.
• It’s OK to rest a bit longer if you need it.
• If you get 15 reps on the last 2 sets of squats or back, increase the weight next time.

PART 2: DEADLIFT/ROW & BENCH/CHEST ALTERNATING SETS
Notes & Instructions
• When choosing a deadlift variation, keep in mind that conventional deadlift is hardest on your lower back. Consider sumo or trap bar as safer
options.
• Control the weight the entire time but do NOT worry about TUT. BANG OUT SOME STRONG REPS!!
• Deadlifts: No belt for the easy and moderate sets. Belt is optional for the hard set. For the All Out set you may wear a belt and straps. Leave
your ego at the door and RESET all of your deadlift reps, except for the last ALL OUT set (you can touch-and-go that set). This will
eliminate the stretch reflex effect and make the exercise HARDER THAN LAST TIME!
• Bench: LEAVE YOUR EGO AT THE DOOR and PAUSE on ALL sets (except the very last ALL OUT set). This will help you avoid injury!!

PART 3: ACCESSORIES CIRUIT/ROTATION
Notes & Instructions
• This is a full-body circuit. Hit all the muscle groups. You can choose any exercise that is appropriate for that muscle.
• Do 2 rounds of circuits/rotations of exercises� You may do more than 2 rounds if you have time at the end of your workout.
• You can swap out exercises based on what YOU want to train� For example, if your calves are already huge but your chest needs more
work, you can swap out the calf exercise for a chest exercise. Use the EXERCISE LIBRARY (pages 58-61) to help you choose.
• If a machine is occupied and you can’t do the full circuit, you can skip an exercise and then do it later.
• Focus on controlling the weight/a slow eccentric.

Moderate Plans
Instructions
• The MODERATE templates are for people who plan to train 4 days per week.
The objective is to train your full body twice per week. There are two splits
within these training plans - a leg day and a chest/back day.
• You may switch between 60- and 90-minute training day plans depending on
time constraints.
• You may also switch between strength and hypertrophy-focused plans. But I
recommend that you stick to etiher a strength or hypertrophy plan for at least
a few months before switching.
• You should repeat these 2-day splits for a long period of time and strive
to progressively overload each time you follow each training day plan. But
you should start out by going EASY and then PROGRESSIVELY INCREASE THE
WEIGHT AND INTENSITY (or any other form of progressive overload per the
progressive overload section of this book)!
• Don’t forget to warm-up with 10 minutes of moderate intensity cardio.
• Make sure you READ the instructions & notes for each exercise where they
are indicated. THEY ARE IMPORTANT!!!! DON’T BE A MORON AND NOT
READ!!!
• Make sure you go in the order of the plans from top to bottom of the page.
All plans begin with a compound movement of choice because those are the
hardest. Don’t bullshit me and do your curls before your bench!
• Rest periods are guidelines� Do the best you can to follow them but don’t
start a compound movement if you’re too tired.
• Weights are just a suggestion of how to progress in weight. Always choose
weights that allow you to achieve the desired intensity in the target rep range.
• Do not go “all out” at first! I do not want you to overtrain. You have to “do
more than last time,” but you also have to crawl before you walk and walk
before you run.
• It may take a month or more before you are able to train to failure/all out.82

• Complete all sets of the exercise before moving onto the next (“straight sets”).
• Control the weight the entire time and focus on TUT of approximately 30-45 seconds per set. Do not rush these exercises. It’s not a

PART 2: LEG & BICEPS ACCESSORIES CIRCUIT/ROTATION
Notes & Instructions
• Complete 3 rounds of this rotation/circuit. Keep in mind that the first two rounds have more exercises than the 3rd round.
• This circuit is intended to hit any muscle groups you want to focus on. You can change the exercises and targeted muscle groups as desired
(for ideas, use the Exercise Library on pages 58-61).
• Focus on controlling the weight/a slow eccentric. Each set should take 30-45 seconds if you are focusing on TUT (which you should
be!!)
• You may use ANY kind of resistance that you have access to. For example, hip thrusts can be done against a band, on a hip thrust machine,
with a kettlebell in your lap, or with a barbell. Use what is available to you!

PART 1: DEADLIFTS
Notes & Instructions
• When choosing a deadlift variation, keep in mind that conventional deadlift is hard on your lower back. Consider sumo or trap bar as safer
options.
• Control the weight the entire time but do NOT worry about TUT. BANG OUT SOME STRONG REPS!!
• Don’t use a belt for the easy and moderate sets. For the hard and all out sets, you may wear a belt and straps.
• First 3 sets of deadlifts should have FULL RESETS. This means that you will pause the weight on the floor in between each rep. For the ALL
OUT set, do touch-and-go style.

PART 2: LEGS & BICEPS ACCESSORIES CIRCUIT/ROTATION
Notes & Instructions
• Choose any 4-6 accessory exercises and complete 3-4 rounds of a rotation/circuit in any order�
• This circuit is to hit any muscle groups you want to focus on (but primarily legs & biceps). You can change the exercises and targeted muscle
groups as desired (for ideas, use the Exercise Library on pages 58-61).
• Focus on controlling the weight/a slow eccentric. Each set should take 30-45 seconds if you are focusing on TUT (which you should
be!!)
• You may use ANY kind of resistance that you have access to. For example, hip thrusts can be done against a band, on a hip thrust machine,
with a kettlebell in your lap, or with a barbell. Use what is available to you!

PART 1: DEADLIFTS
Notes & Instructions
• When choosing a deadlift variation, keep in mind that conventional deadlift is hard on your lower back. Consider sumo or trap bar as safer
options.
• Control the weight the entire time but do NOT worry about TUT. BANG OUT SOME STRONG REPS!!
• Don’t use a belt for the easy and moderate sets. For the hard and all out sets, you may wear a belt and straps.
